# app-PublicToDo

Hey guys, this is my first python project coming from a .NET background.

The plan is, 
  a) create a simple client-server application to understand the basic sockets in python
    (This is done, see PublicToDo.App.Server and .Client)
  b) create a public to do list, where anyone in the world can add to it.
  
How will i go about creating the public to do list?
  a) Create an api project using Python Flask (web framework), Flast-Restless (web api framework), and Flask-SQLAlchemy (database adapters)
    (Have a look in the repo, this is the "API" project)
  b)Use angular or ember to create a simple frontend and connect to the api project
  c)Use web sockets to update users in real time if someone adds a ToDo item
